<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hey there! I'm a bubbly 21-year-old with a zest for life that's as vibrant as a rainbow. 
  By day, I'm diving deep into the world of web development, crafting digital wonders with lines of code and pixels. 
  But when the sun sets, you'll find me exploring the realms of spirituality, delving into mindfulness practices and 
  seeking harmony in the universe. Music is the rhythm that pulses through my veins, whether I'm strumming a guitar, 
  losing myself in the beat of a drum, or simply soaking in the melodies of life. 
  Fashion isn't just about clothes for me; it's a form of self-expression, a canvas on which I paint my personality with colors, 
  textures, and styles. And nature? Well, that's my sanctuary, my escape from the hustle and bustle of the world, where I find peace in the whisper 
  of the wind and the dance of the trees.</p>

<p>I graduated high school back in 2021 and have been working in the restaurant industry ever since. But guess what? I'm getting ready to head back to school soon. And here's the cool part â€“ 
  I've recently discovered a real passion for coding websites. It's like finding a hidden talent in the online world, 
  where every bit of code feels like a puzzle piece fitting perfectly into place. I'm super excited to dive deeper into web 
  development as I continue my education. It's all about turning pixels into something awesome and creating digital experiences that people love. 
  Can't wait to see where this journey takes me!</p>
